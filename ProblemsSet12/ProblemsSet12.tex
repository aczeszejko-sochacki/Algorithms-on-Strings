\section{Solution}
 Given n strings $S_1, S_2, \dots, S_N$, firstly note, that the shortest superstring (OPT) satisfies the formula:
  \begin{equation}
   |OPT| = \sum_i^NS_i - \sum_{i > 1}^N|overlap(S_{i-1}, S_i)|
  \end{equation}
 Where strings $S_i$ are indexed in the order of occurences in the supertring.
 Hence we need to maximize $\sum_{i > 1}^N|overlap(S_{i-1}, S_i)|$.
 Construct a weighted graph with the following properties:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Each node $v_i$ represents the string $S_i$
  \item The weight of the edge $v_iv_j$ equals $overlap(S_i, S_j)$
  \item Add $v_0$ node as the start node, weight of $v_0v_i = 0$ for each i
 \end{itemize}
 Then note, that the maximum value of $\sum_{i > 1}^N|overlap(S_{i-1}, S_i)|$
 is equivalent to the Hamiltonian path in this graph. We are going to solve the problem of
 finding Hamiltonian path using Held-Karp dynamic algorithm for TSP (without the last edge, because the
 last string does not overlap with the first).
 
 \begin{lema}[Shortest path from $S_i$ to $S_j$]
  Let $min\_path(S_i, S_j, n)$ - the cheapest path from $S_i$ to $S_j$ visiting exactly n nodes. Then
  \begin{equation}
   min\_path(S_i, S_j, n) = \min(min\_path(S_i, S_k, n-1) + v_kv_j)
  \end{equation}
  for $k \notin {S_i, S_j}$
 \end{lema}

 We added $v_0$ to the graph, because we do not have predefined start. Start at $v_0$ and consecutively
 build the cheapest paths of length $1, 2, \dots, N$ to get the final result. The time complexity of computing the operation in lemma is $\mathcal{O}(n)$. We have $\mathcal{O}(n*2^n)$ subproblems, so the
 final time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(n^2*2^n)$.
